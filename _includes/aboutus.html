            <h2>The Mission</h2>
            <p>
                When we hear Speech & Debate, we think of a three word phrase.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                And that is: <b>Being. Wholly. Yourself.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand the fear of speaking in public, but it doesn’t have to be that way. That’s why we’ve created free courses designed to guide you through the fundamentals of Speech & Debate. Whether you’re looking to step out of your comfort zone or elevate your existing skills, our programs are here to support you.
            </p>
