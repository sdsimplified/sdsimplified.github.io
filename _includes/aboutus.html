              When we hear Speech & Debate, we think of a three word phrase.
              <br>
          </p>
          <p>
              And that is: <b>Being. Wholly. Yourself.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that <b>students themselves are the most powerful agents</b> at shifting the tectonic plates of the future. In a world where <b>AI is disrupting everything</b>, the importance of <b>being a skilled human communicator</b> will never change.
