          <h2>The Mission</h2>
          <p>
              When we hear Speech & Debate, we think of a three word phrase.
              <br>
          </p>
          <p>
              And that is: <b>Being. Wholly. Yourself.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
              We believe that students themselves are the most powerful agents at shifting the tectonic plates of the future. In a world where AI is disrupting everything, the importance of being a skilled human communicator will never change. Here at SD Simplified, we help you inspire audiences and command respect.
