        <h2>The Mission</h2>
      <p>
      When we hear Speech & Debate, we think of a three word phrase. 
      <br>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      And that is: <b>Being. Wholly. Yourself.</b> 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      We understand the fear of speaking in public, but it doesn’t have to be that way. That’s why we’ve created free courses designed to guide you through the fundamentals of Speech & Debate. 
      Whether you’re looking to step out of your comfort zone or elevate your existing skills, our programs are here to support you.
      </p>
      <p>
      For seasoned competitors, our bootcamps, led by the world’s top performers in the field, offer unparalleled expertise and insights.
