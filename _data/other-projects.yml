  description: My name is Sashank Balusu and I'm currently a sophomore at Archbishop Mitty High School. I love speech and debate so much because it gives everyone a platform to talk about the world and issues they care about. I'm apart of this program because I know firsthand that other speech and debate camps and programs can be very confusing, especially when you are first starting out and I'm glad that there's finally a program that will help absolute beginners learn speech and debate!

Words cannot explain my love for speech and debate because it gives everyone a chance to express and voice their opinion or raise an argument about a specific topic, and being part of a course which guides those on gaining knowledge about speech and debate is amazing. I cannot wait to work and teach all of you!! I am a national debater, I've participated in 15+ debate tournaments including inter-school, regional, state and national. I have also been a national qualifier for a debate competition for the NSDA. I also am the founder and the president of my debate club in my high school where we have 50+ members.
