  description: Ariv inhabits the space between the 8 and 80-year-old. He is a conscious creator of music, poem, and art, a curious explorer of the reality joining technology to humanity (a.k.a. the anti-tech-tech-club), and currently training for his first ultramarathon. He is also a nationally awarded public speaker and talented procurer of free time. He loves long windy conversations, laughable periods of confusion, and never having a plan (perhaps why he's so confused!). Due to his eccentricity, some refer to him as "The Brown Dr. Seuss"â€“others will tell you only he calls himself that. They are largely correct.
