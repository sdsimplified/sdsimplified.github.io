I love speech and debate so much because it gives everyone a platform to talk about the world and issues they care about. I'm apart of this program because I know firsthand that other speech and debate camps and programs can be very confusing, especially when you are first starting out and I'm glad that there's finally a program that will help absolute beginners learn speech and debate!
