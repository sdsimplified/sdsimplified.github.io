His sessions and advice gave me so much confidence within speech and debate, but also beyond it as well. Without him, I definitely would not be the same orator, let alone person that I am today."

He helped me find a topic that's important to me and articulate my thoughts perfectly in my writing. He is also a great and kind, supportive person. He is someone that I always know is there for me if I ever need."
