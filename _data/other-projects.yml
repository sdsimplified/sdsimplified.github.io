  description: When we hear Speech & Debate, we think of a three word phrase. And that is being unapologetically yourself. We know how it feels to be afraid of speaking, but it should not be that way. So we built a course designed to help students navigate through the fundamentals of the best activity to get them out of their comfort zone, Speech & Debate.
