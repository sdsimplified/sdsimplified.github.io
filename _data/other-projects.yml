  description: My name is Aneesh Mardikar and I'm currently a senior at Archbishop Mitty High School. To me, speech and debate is the activity of a lifetime: building fundamental skills with no end to their usefulness and genuine relationships with no end to their joy is an insane experience. I'm here to make those things more accessible, because I don't think they should be limited by the complexities of the activity, but bolstered by them. By simplifying the introduction to speech and debate, we can make that vision a reality.

  description: My name is Sashank Balusu and I'm currently a senior at Archbishop Mitty High School. I love speech and debate so much because it gives everyone a platform to talk about the world and issues they care about. I'm apart of this program because I know firsthand that other speech and debate camps and programs can be very confusing, especially when you are first starting out and I'm glad that there's finally a program that will help absolute beginners learn speech and debate!
